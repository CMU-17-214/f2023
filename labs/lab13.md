# Lab 13 - Design Pattern Review

In this recitation, you will provide an overview of three crucial design patterns: **Strategy**, **Template**, and **Decorator**. For each pattern, your task is to articulate key aspects, discuss scenarios where it is beneficial, highlight situations where it might not be the best choice, and present a UML diagram from *Santorini or past homework* that demonstrates the pattern.


## Deliverables
- [ ] Fill out the **Strategy** pattern template and answer follow-up questions of the TA
- [ ] Fill out the **Template** pattern template and answer follow-up questions of the TA
- [ ] Fill out the **Decorator** pattern template and answer follow-up questions of the TA

## Introduction
Throughout the semester, we've delved into seven commonly used design patterns: **Strategy**, **Template**, **Decorator**, **Composite**, **Observer**, **Proxy**, and **Adapter**.

In this lab, we will focus on the first three.

For each design pattern, you are expected to provide information in four sections:

- **Description**: Define the key characteristics that distinguish the pattern from others.
- **Pros**: Explain when and why you would choose this pattern. Focus on its advantages in terms of design principles and coding styles.
- **Cons**: Identify scenarios where choosing this pattern might be suboptimal. Focus on what makes it less preferable compared to alternative choices.
- **UML Diagram/Code snippet**: Present a UML diagram illustrating a concrete scenario in the Santorini God Cards context. For the other design patterns, feel free to use examples from other past assignments.

1. Create a copy of the template at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-j6jTDt1VLfUzJaF_kp-3blUSpXp-U7BGSPdN4vt08/edit?usp=sharing

### Tips

- Strive to devise your explanations before consulting external sources.
- While you are only required to explain three design patterns to the TA, feel free to continue filling in the information for the remaining patterns and seek clarification or assistance from the TA if needed.
